# Do not upload a file with a same name to a file in the same folder.
  doing that would replace the old file with the new one,the old file just rest-in-peace.
  
  this is used for people to update their own file,not used to f**k up others' file.
  
  I hope nobody shall be that bad person,making fun of others' pain.
  
# notice:
  some codes are not modified(or copied) by others in their teaching blogs.I had put links on the front these codes.of course I had no rights with these codes.thanks for the original authors to write blogs to teach me so much.thank you.
  
  if you are one of these authors,but you don't want me use your code ,please tell me.I will rewrite that part.
  
# how to use:

  simple: (in windows)
  
          double click.
	  
          it will show start and show you what you wanna know.
	  
          (in linux)
	  
          cd to the folder witch exsimple.py in.
	  
          python3 exsimple.py
	  
          it will show start and show you what you wanna know.
	  
  advanced:
  
          open the score code to change whatever you want.
	  
          also,notice that if you use pypy3 instead of python3,it might run far faster.
